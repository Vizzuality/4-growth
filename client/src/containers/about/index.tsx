          <p className="leading-6 text-slate-300">
            The 4Growth Visualisation Platform provides key insights into the
            current and future uptake of digital and data-driven technologies in
            the agriculture and forestry markets. Through interaction with the
            platform, users will see where and how different technologies are
            being implemented in their sectors of choice and allows them to
            understand how the market is likely to evolve.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-6 text-slate-300">
            This rich information will illuminate key market trends which can
            help potential adopters of digital technologies reduce their
            investment risk and better understand the benefits of technology
            adoption.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-6 text-slate-300">
            The information presented on the platform is derived from analysis
            which incorporates both &quot;ground truth&quot; data gathered from
            individual farmers, foresters and technology ecosystem stakeholders
            all across Europe along with &quot;macro-level&quot; economic data
            and projections.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-6 text-slate-300">
            This &quot;bottom-up&quot; and &quot;top-down&quot; approach aims to
            provide a robust and holistic perspective on market modelling.

            The objective of 4Growth is to understand where, how and to what
            extent digital and data technologies in agriculture and forestry are
            being adopted. It will do so by collecting a wide range of ground
            truth data via distributed observatories across Europe and
            identifying key factors or constraints for uptake. 4Growth will
            showcase the uptake through the &apos;4Growth Visualisation
            Platform&apos; that will combine powerful storytelling with advanced
            visualisation of market data. This will contribute to a deeper
            knowledge of what influences market adoption, which in turn will
            allow 4Growth to develop robust forecasts to guide policymaking and
            increase further uptake.
