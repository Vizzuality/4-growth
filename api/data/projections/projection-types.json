For example, in the case of recording and mapping technologies, a farmer may purchase:</p><ul><li><strong>Hardware</strong> (e.g. a drone)</li><li><strong>Software</strong> (e.g. mapping software to process drone data)</li><li><strong>Service</strong> (e.g. outsourcing mapping to a third-party provider)</li></ul><p>Units for shipments vary by component. Hardware shipments are measured in units (each representing a purchased device), while software shipments are measured in no. of subscriptions. Shipments are calculated by dividing revenue by price.</p>"

Depending on the technology component, this may be measured in units (for hardware) or subscriptions (for software). The installed base is calculated by summing shipments over the product's lifetime, accounting for equipment reaching end of life or software licenses that have expired. This provides an accurate picture of the technologies actively in operation.</p>"
